Proxmox VE is a free, open-source virtualization platform that lets you run virtual machines and containers on a single host. It's the foundation of most homelabs, and in this guide we'll walk through the entire installation process from downloading the ISO to logging into the web interface for the first time.

{/* truncate */}

## What is Proxmox VE?

Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) is a Debian-based platform for managing virtual machines (KVM) and Linux containers (LXC) through a web interface. It supports ZFS, clustering, backups, and a lot more — but all of that comes later. First, we need to get it installed.

If you've ever installed a Linux distro, this process will feel familiar. If you haven't, don't worry — the installer does most of the work.

## What You'll Need

- A dedicated machine (mini PC, old desktop, server — anything x86_64)
- A USB flash drive (at least 2GB)
- A monitor and keyboard connected to the machine (just for the install)
- Another computer to download the ISO and create the boot drive

### Minimum Hardware

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 64-bit with Intel VT-x or AMD-V | Any modern Intel/AMD processor |
| RAM | 2GB (host only) | 8GB+ (more RAM = more VMs) |
| Storage | 8GB | 128GB+ SSD or NVMe |
| Network | 1 NIC | Gigabit or better |

:::tip
Proxmox runs great on mini PCs. A used Intel NUC or any of the GMKtec/Beelink/MinisForum boxes on Amazon will work perfectly for a homelab.
:::

## Step 1: Download the ISO

Head to the official Proxmox download page and grab the latest ISO:

**https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads**

Look for **Proxmox VE ISO Installer** — as of this writing, the latest version is **9.x**. Download the `.iso` file (around 1.2GB).

:::note
Make sure you're downloading the **VE** (Virtual Environment) installer, not the Backup Server or Mail Gateway.
:::

## Step 2: Create a Bootable USB

You need to flash the ISO to a USB drive. The tool you use depends on your operating system.

### On Windows

Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).

If using **Rufus**, select the ISO and choose **DD mode** when prompted — this is important. The default ISO mode won't work correctly with Proxmox.

### On macOS

Use [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) (graphical) or the command line:

```bash
# Find your USB drive
diskutil list

# Unmount it (replace diskX with your drive)
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX

# Flash the ISO (use rdiskX for faster writes)
sudo dd if=proxmox-ve_*.iso of=/dev/rdiskX bs=1M
```

### On Linux

```bash
# Replace /dev/sdX with your USB drive
sudo dd bs=1M conv=fdatasync if=./proxmox-ve_*.iso of=/dev/sdX
```

:::danger
Double-check the target drive before running `dd` — it will overwrite everything on the target without confirmation. Use `lsblk` to identify the correct device.
:::

## Step 3: Boot from USB

1. Plug the USB drive into your target machine
2. Power on and enter the BIOS/UEFI (usually by pressing `F2`, `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC` during boot — it varies by manufacturer)
3. Set the USB drive as the first boot device, or use the boot menu to select it
4. Save and exit BIOS

You should see the Proxmox VE installer boot screen.

## Step 4: Start the Installer

When the Proxmox boot menu appears, you'll see several options:

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)** | Default — use this |
| Install Proxmox VE (Terminal UI) | If the graphical installer doesn't display correctly |
| Install Proxmox VE (Terminal UI, Serial Console) | Headless servers with serial access |
| Advanced Options | Debug mode, rescue boot |
| Memory Test | Run memtest86+ to check RAM |

Select **Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)** and press Enter.

## Step 5: Accept the EULA

The first screen is the End User License Agreement. Read through it if you'd like, then click **I agree** to continue.

## Step 6: Select the Target Disk

This is where Proxmox will be installed. Select the disk you want to use from the dropdown.

:::danger
The selected disk will be completely erased. Make sure you're choosing the right one, especially if your machine has multiple drives.
:::

### Filesystem Options

Click the **Options** button to configure the filesystem. This is an important decision:

| Filesystem | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **ext4** | The default. Reliable, well-supported, uses LVM. | Most single-disk setups |
| **XFS** | Similar to ext4, also uses LVM. Slightly better performance with large files. | Single-disk setups |
| **ZFS** | Advanced filesystem with built-in RAID, snapshots, and data integrity checks. | Multi-disk setups, data protection |
| **BTRFS** | Modern copy-on-write filesystem. Considered a technology preview in Proxmox. | Not recommended for production |

For a single-disk homelab setup, **ext4 is the safe default**. If you have multiple disks and want software RAID with built-in data integrity, **ZFS** is the way to go — but it uses more RAM (roughly 1GB per TB of storage).

### Advanced LVM Options (ext4/XFS)

If you click **Options** with ext4 or XFS selected, you can tweak:

| Setting | What It Does | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `hdsize` | Total disk space to use (leave empty for full disk) | Full disk |
| `swapsize` | Swap partition size | Equal to installed RAM (capped at 4-8GB) |
| `maxroot` | Max size of the root volume | Varies |
| `maxvz` | Max size of the data volume | Remaining space |
| `minfree` | Free space to leave on the LVM volume group | Varies |

For most homelab setups, the defaults are fine. Leave these alone unless you have a specific reason to change them.

### ZFS Options

If you select ZFS, you'll choose a RAID level and target disk(s):

| RAID Level | Min. Disks | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| RAID0 | 1 | Stripe, no redundancy — a single disk failure loses everything |
| RAID1 | 2 | Mirror — data duplicated across disks |
| RAID10 | 4 | Stripe of mirrors — performance + redundancy |
| RAIDZ-1 | 3 | Single-parity — survives one disk failure |
| RAIDZ-2 | 4 | Double-parity — survives two disk failures |
| RAIDZ-3 | 5 | Triple-parity — survives three disk failures |

:::warning
Do **not** use ZFS on top of a hardware RAID controller. ZFS needs direct access to the disks. Using it with hardware RAID can result in data loss.
:::

## Step 7: Set Location and Timezone

Select your:

- **Country** — used to pick the closest download mirror
- **Timezone** — important for accurate logs and scheduled tasks
- **Keyboard layout** — usually auto-detected

## Step 8: Set the Admin Password

Set the root password and provide an email address:

- **Password** — at least 8 characters; use something strong since this is root access to your hypervisor
- **Email** — used for system notifications (cron job reports, update alerts). Can be any valid email address

:::tip
You'll use this password to log into both the web interface and SSH. Pick something you won't forget, or add it to your password manager right now.
:::

## Step 9: Configure Networking

This is the most important configuration screen. Get this wrong and you won't be able to access the web interface after installation.

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| **Management Interface** | Select your network adapter (if you have multiple, pick the one connected to your network) |
| **Hostname (FQDN)** | A fully qualified domain name, e.g., `pve.local` or `proxmox.yourdomain.com` |
| **IP Address (CIDR)** | A static IP on your network, e.g., `192.168.1.100/24` |
| **Gateway** | Your router's IP, e.g., `192.168.1.1` |
| **DNS Server** | Your DNS server — your router IP or a public DNS like `1.1.1.1` |

:::warning
Use a **static IP** that's outside your router's DHCP range to avoid conflicts. Check your router's DHCP settings to see what range it's handing out.
:::

:::note
The hostname must be a valid FQDN (fully qualified domain name). Something like `pve` alone won't work — use `pve.local`, `proxmox.home`, or whatever fits your network naming.
:::

## Step 10: Review and Install

The summary screen shows all your selections. Review everything — especially the target disk, IP address, and hostname. Use the **Previous** button to go back and fix anything.

When you're satisfied, click **Install**.

The installer will:
1. Format the target disk
2. Extract and install packages
3. Configure the system
4. Set up the bootloader

This takes a few minutes depending on your hardware. When it's done, the system will ask you to reboot. **Remove the USB drive** before the machine boots back up.

## Step 11: Access the Web Interface

After the reboot, you'll see a console login screen on the monitor. It will display the URL to access the web interface:

```
https://your-ip-address:8006
```

Open that URL in a browser on another computer on the same network.

### The Certificate Warning

You'll see a browser warning about an untrusted certificate. This is expected — Proxmox uses a self-signed certificate by default. Click through the warning:

- **Chrome:** Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to site"
- **Firefox:** Click "Advanced" → "Accept the Risk and Continue"

### Log In

- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** the password you set during installation
- **Realm:** `Linux PAM standard authentication`

You're in. Welcome to Proxmox.

:::note Subscription Notice
On first login (and on every login), you'll see a dialog about not having a valid subscription. This is cosmetic — Proxmox VE is fully functional without a subscription. Click **OK** to dismiss it. In the next guide, we'll cover the post-install steps including how to switch to the no-subscription repository.

## What's Next

You've got a working Proxmox VE installation. The next step is the [post-install guide](/blog/proxmox-post-install-guide), where we'll switch to the correct repositories, update packages, remove the subscription nag, and get familiar with the web interface. After that:

- **[Create your first LXC container](/blog/proxmox-create-lxc-container)** — the lightweight default for most homelab services
- **[Create your first virtual machine](/blog/proxmox-create-virtual-machine)** — for when you need a full OS or hardware passthrough
- **[Storage](/blog/proxmox-storage-guide)** | **[Networking](/blog/proxmox-networking-guide)** | **[Backups](/blog/proxmox-backup-guide)** — the rest of the foundation series
