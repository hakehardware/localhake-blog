LXC containers are the workhorse of most Proxmox homelabs. They're lightweight, fast, and use a fraction of the resources a full VM requires. In this guide, we'll download a container template, create a Debian container, configure its networking, and log in — giving you a running Linux environment in under five minutes.

{/* truncate */}

## Prerequisites

- A working Proxmox VE 9.x installation with the [post-install steps](/blog/proxmox-post-install-guide) completed
- Access to the web interface (`https://your-ip:8006`)

## VMs vs Containers — When to Use Which

Before we dive in, it's worth understanding why you'd pick a container over a VM.

| | LXC Container | Virtual Machine |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel** | Shares the host kernel | Runs its own kernel |
| **Boot time** | Seconds | 30+ seconds |
| **RAM overhead** | Minimal | Needs its own OS in memory |
| **Disk overhead** | Minimal | Full OS install |
| **Isolation** | Process-level (namespaces) | Full hardware-level |
| **Use case** | Most Linux services, Docker hosts | Full OS (Windows, HAOS), hardware passthrough, untrusted workloads |

**Rule of thumb:** Use a container unless you need a full OS, hardware passthrough, or you're running something you don't fully trust. Containers are the default choice for homelabs.

## Step 1: Download a Container Template

Before you can create a container, you need a template — a minimal root filesystem image for your chosen Linux distribution.

### Via the Web Interface

1. In the left sidebar, expand your node and click **local** (your-node-name)
2. Click **CT Templates**
3. Click **Templates**
4. Find **debian-12-standard** in the list (or search for it)
5. Click **Download**

Wait for the download to finish. You'll see a task log confirming success.

### Via the Command Line

```bash
# Update the template database
pveam update

# List available system templates
pveam available --section system
```

You'll see a list of templates. Download Debian 12:

```bash
# Download the Debian 12 template to local storage
pveam download local debian-12-standard_12.7-1_amd64.tar.zst
```

:::note
The template version number may differ — use whatever is listed by `pveam available`. Debian 12 (Bookworm) is a solid default choice for containers.
:::

## Step 2: Create the Container

### Via the Web Interface

Click **Create CT** in the top-right corner of the web interface. This opens the container creation wizard.

### General Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Node** | Your Proxmox node (auto-selected if you only have one) |
| **CT ID** | A unique numeric ID, e.g., `100` |
| **Hostname** | A name for the container, e.g., `debian-test` |
| **Password** | Root password for the container |
| **Confirm Password** | Same password again |

Leave **Unprivileged container** checked — this is the default and is the recommended setting.

:::info Privileged vs Unprivileged
**Unprivileged** containers map the container's root user to a non-root user on the host. Even if something escapes the container, it has no host-level privileges. This is what you should use for almost everything.

**Privileged** containers give the container's root user actual root-level access on the host. Only use these when absolutely required (certain NFS setups, some hardware access scenarios).
:::

### Template Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Storage** | `local` |
| **Template** | Select the Debian 12 template you downloaded |

### Disks Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Storage** | `local-lvm` (or `local-zfs` if you installed with ZFS) |
| **Disk size** | `8` GB is fine for a basic container. Adjust based on what you plan to run. |

### CPU Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Cores** | `1` — plenty for a basic container. Increase later if needed. |

### Memory Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Memory** | `512` MB — enough for a minimal Debian container |
| **Swap** | `512` MB |

:::tip
These resources are soft limits — the container only uses what it actually needs. You can always increase them later without recreating the container. Start small and scale up.
:::

### Network Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Bridge** | `vmbr0` (the default bridge connected to your physical NIC) |
| **IPv4** | `Static` — then enter an IP like `192.168.1.100/24` |
| **Gateway** | Your router's IP, e.g., `192.168.1.1` |
| **IPv6** | Leave as `Static` with empty fields (unless you use IPv6) |

:::warning
Pick a static IP outside your router's DHCP range to avoid conflicts. Alternatively, you can select `DHCP` to have your router assign an address — but static is recommended so you always know where to find the container.
:::

### DNS Tab

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **DNS domain** | Leave blank (inherits from host) |
| **DNS servers** | Leave blank (inherits from host) or enter your DNS server |

### Confirm Tab

Review everything, then click **Finish**. The container is created in seconds.

## Step 3: Start the Container

The container doesn't start automatically. You can start it in two ways:

**Web interface:** Select the container in the sidebar, then click **Start** in the top-right.

**Command line:**

```bash
pct start 100
```

## Step 4: Log In

### Via the Web Interface Console

Select your container in the sidebar, then click **Console**. You'll see a login prompt:

```
debian-test login: root
Password: (enter the password you set during creation)
```

### Via SSH (From Your Local Machine)

If you assigned a static IP during creation:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.100
```

:::note
SSH may not accept root password login by default on some templates. If it doesn't work, use the web console first and check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for `PermitRootLogin`.
:::

## Step 5: Update the Container

First thing you should do inside any new container — update the packages:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 6: Verify Networking

Make sure the container can reach the internet:

```bash
ping -c 3 google.com
```

If that works, your container has working DNS and internet access. If it doesn't, double-check:

- The IP address and gateway you configured
- That `vmbr0` is correctly bridged to your physical NIC (check under your node → System → Network)
- That your DNS server is reachable

## Common Operations

Here are the commands you'll use most often to manage containers.

### From the Proxmox Host

```bash
# List all containers
pct list

# Start / stop / restart a container
pct start 100
pct stop 100
pct restart 100

# Open a shell inside the container (no SSH needed)
pct enter 100

# Check container config
pct config 100

# Resize disk (increase only)
pct resize 100 rootfs +5G

# Change memory
pct set 100 -memory 1024

# Change CPU cores
pct set 100 -cores 2
```

### From Inside the Container

The container is a normal Linux environment. Install packages, run services, and configure things exactly as you would on a regular Debian system.

```bash
# Install a package
apt install nginx

# Check running services
systemctl status nginx

# View resource usage
free -h
df -h
```

## Enabling Nesting (For Docker Inside LXC)

If you plan to run Docker inside this container, you need to enable **nesting**. This is a common setup for homelab services that ship as Docker Compose stacks.

You can enable it on an existing container (stop it first):

**Web interface:** Select the container → **Options** → **Features** → check **Nesting** and **keyctl**

**Command line:**

```bash
# Stop the container first
pct stop 100

# Enable nesting and keyctl
pct set 100 -features nesting=1,keyctl=1

# Start it again
pct start 100
```

After this, you can install Docker inside the container normally:

```bash
pct enter 100
apt update && apt install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

:::note
For most workloads, Docker-inside-LXC works great and is lighter than running Docker inside a full VM. If you need maximum isolation or plan to do live migration, a VM is the better choice.

## What's Next

You've got a running container — now you can install whatever service you want inside it. In the next guide, we'll cover [creating a virtual machine](/blog/proxmox-create-virtual-machine) for situations where a full VM is the better tool. After that:

- **[Storage — Disks, ZFS, LVM, and Network Mounts](/blog/proxmox-storage-guide)** — add disks, create pools, mount NFS/SMB shares
- **[Networking — VLANs, Bridges, and Firewall](/blog/proxmox-networking-guide)** — segment your network and secure traffic
- **[Backups — Scheduling and Restoring](/blog/proxmox-backup-guide)** — protect your VMs and containers
